                  <h3>What Is A Gastroenterologist?</h3>
                  <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                      A gastroenterologist is a physician who specializes in the
                      gastrointestinal tract (including the esophagus, stomach,
                      small and large intestine) and other digestive organs
                      (liver, pancreas, bile ducts, and gall bladder).
                      Gastroenterologists see patients in the hospital and
                      clinic, and also perform endoscopic procedures (e.g.,
                      upper endoscopy and colonoscopy).
                    </p>

                  <h3>Is Colon Cancer Preventable?</h3>
                  <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                      Yes, a colonoscopy may detect polyps (small growths on the
                      lining of the colon). Your gastroenterologist will remove
                      these polyps during the colonoscopy. Removal of polyps
                      will result in a major reduction in the likelihood of
                      developing colorectal cancer in the future.

                    <p>
                      If you are 45 years or older, have a family history of GI
                      cancer, or if you have complained to your family doctor
                      about digestive problem such as frequent abdominal pain,
                      nausea, diarrhea, constipation, or heartburn, something is

                  <h3>Why do I need an endoscopy/colonoscopy?</h3>
                  <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                      Many people suffer from aliments of the gastrointestinal
                      tract. Most of these diseases are found more quickly and
                      assessed more fully through the use of
                      endoscopy/colonoscopy. Since the advent of this
                      technology, many intestinal diseases are diagnosed earlier
                      and some can even be treated without invasive surgery.
                    </p>

                  <h3>Is endoscopy/colonoscopy safe?</h3>
                  <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                      The short answer is yes. Although all medical procedures
                      carry some level of risk of complications,
                      endoscopy/colonoscopy has been proven to be very safe,
                      with an overall low level of risk. Of course, this level
                      depends greatly upon what procedure is being performed,
                      your overall health status, and the level of skill and/or
                      training of the doctor doing your test. Before your
                      procedure your doctor will review the risks with you. This
                      is not to make you uncomfortable or to scare you, but
                      rather to inform you so that you can make an informed
                      decision regarding the exam.

                  <h3>Health Risks of Obesity</h3>
                  <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                      Obesity is a disease defined as having an excess of body
                      weight, specifically a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or
                      higher. In the U.S., 39.8% of adults over the age of 20
                      suffer from obesity. The disease usually results from
                      consuming more calories than you burn off, which is then
                      stored as body fat. However, genetics, metabolic and
                      behavioral factors can cause obesity as well. Those
                      affected are at higher risk of developing more serious
                      health conditions.

                    <p>
                      Skin tags are a benign (noncancerous) skin growth that
                      often forms on the armpit, neck, upper chest, groin, or
                      eyelids. Tags are usually small in size and do not grow
                      larger once formed. In most cases, skin tags do not have
                      any adverse symptoms.

                      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy harnesses the body’s
                      natural ability to heal itself by concentrating the
                      elements in your own blood that promote growth and healing
                      into a powerful serum directly injected into the area in
                      need of repair. In aesthetic medicine, this regenerative
                      treatment can be combined with other procedures or used on
                      its own.

                      The Skin Clinic Medspa offers two types of PRP treatment:
                      the PRP Glow Up Booster and PRP Hair Restoration. Our Glow
                      Up Booster combines the healing properties of PRP with
                      collagen injections targeted to restore volume and reduce
                      the look of scarring or wrinkles for a targeted effect
                      that stimulates your natural healing where it can do the
                      most good. PRP Hair Restoration helps to address hair loss
                      or thinning hair by injecting the healing plasma into the
                      scalp at the level of the hair follicles to promote hair
                      growth.

                    <p>
                      You can expect a PRP treatment to take an hour or two,
                      depending on the exact procedure you’re having. This
                      includes the time you’ll need for your blood to be drawn
                      and spun in a centrifuge to extract the desired elements.

                    <p>
                      Adding PRP to a dermal filler injection doesn’t change the
                      expected downtime—which is to say, there really isn’t any!
                      You might experience a little redness in the area of the
                      injection that should go away within a day.

                  <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                      Dermal fillers are recommended to improve the appearance
                      of areas where your natural fat and collagen have reduced
                      over time. A combined injection at those sites allows the
                      PRP to stimulate your body to replace collagen and elastin
                      that have been lost while the filler provides an instant
                      volume corrector. Patients receiving this combined
                      treatment report results that can last up to six months
                      longer than that of fillers alone.

                  <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                      Both men and women who suffer from thinning hair or weak
                      hair growth are candidates for PRP treatment. PRP works
                      best on areas where there is existing hair that is
                      thinning, rather than on areas that are completely bald.

                    When can I expect to see results from my PRP hair treatment
                    and how long will they last?

                  <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                      For the best results, plan on repeating your treatments
                      monthly for the first three to four months, and then every
                      three to six months thereafter, depending on your
                      individual response to the therapy and your results. It
                      usually takes at least six months to accurately judge the
                      degree of regrowth. However, you will probably notice
                      decreased hair shedding well before then.
